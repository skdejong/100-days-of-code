# 100 Days Of Code Log

### Introduction

![Image](./Images/super_64.png) 

Welcome to my #100 Days of Code Log as I take on the challenge to code at least an hour a day for the next 100 days! I am joining the brave new world of learning how to code by starting the School of Code's full stack web development bootcamp. It's full time for the next four months but it's also free. The application process was lengthy but they only accepted 130 people out of nearly 3000 applicants. How could I turn down the opportunity?

### Day 1: 26 September 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned new CSS selectors and practiced them while pair programming with CSS Diner

**Link(s) to work**: [CSS Diner](https://lnkd.in/ePbUsARa) 

**Thoughts:** Made it through my first day at School of Code and loved it. The founder and CEO, Chris Meah, told us today that a more accurate name for School of Code is "Technology Career Intensive Onboarding of Collaborative Creative Problem Solvers." I am excited to start my journey learning to code with all these new people!

    - Decompose the problem (break it down into smaller parts)
    - Recognize patterns
    - Abstraction (filter out/ignore the characteristics of the problem that are not needed).
    - Create algorithms

- Started a newbie challenge on Front End Mentor with my new programming pair partner for this week (https://lnkd.in/eBKh6P4e)
#javascript #programming #agile #uiux

**Thoughts:** My inspirational quote for today. Saw this and it's perfect for me as I start week 3 of coding bootcamp. What new thing will you be brave enough to suck at?

¬∑ Made a user journey flow diagram on www.lucidchart.com
¬∑ Created low and high-fidelity wireframes using www.figma.com and miro.com
¬∑ Chose our colour scheme (via coolors.co) and tested our colours for accessibility. For example, we checked to see if the colours we chose had enough contrast so that people who are colour-blind can still distinguish them.
#uiuxdesign #collaboration

### Day 20: 15 October 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Continued coding functions, loops, and arrays for the JavaScript Recap workshop with School Of Code.
- One of the many things I love about School of Code is they connect each of us with a mentor who works in the tech industry already and is willing to meet with us 1:1 each week. Arthur is my mentor and he has encouraged me so much already with his tips, advice, and support. He sent me an inspiring quote this morning when I was feeling discouraged and I've been repeating it to myself all day. Thank you, Arthur!

    o  Imported JSON data using CommonJS
¬∑ My favourite quote from our coach, Loz, today (paraphrased):  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt really understand something in coding just by watching someone do it. You only become familiar with it that way. You have to do it to understand it.‚Äù
#backenddevelopment #nodejs #json #debugging

### Day 22: 18 October 2022

#sql #database

### Day 28: 25 October 2022

**Today's Progress**:
‚ñ™ Learned about joining SQL tables, SQL keywords, functions, and how to query a database. I am loving SQL so far.

#sql #postgresql

### Day 29: 26 October 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Today, we learned how to connect a library to a database.
‚ñ™ Created a Postgres database on ElephantSQL.
‚ñ™ Created Environment variables.

#apitesting #cypress #freecodecamp

### Day 36: 3 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Forked the #100daysofcode template and added all my notes from Notion, Tweets, and posts on LinkedIn from my first 35 days of the challenge into this 100 Days of Code log. It's a clear sign of how far I have come in a such a short time since when I started the 100 Days of Code challenge I didn't know how to use Github or VSCode and definitely didn't know how to fork a repo!
- Learned about NoSQL from guest speakers from Couchbase
- With my pair programming partner this week we created our own Kata for Code Wars and the tests required to check our CodeWarrior's solutions. We started with some simple ones which worked fine. Then we started creating a more complicated one but haven't finished it yet.
- We also learned about NoSQL from Couchbase at School of Code today. It was interesting to learn more about it.

### Day 37: 4 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- It was Hackathon Friday at School of Code. Our goal was to create testable code for end-to-end testing and API integration testing. We did our End-to-End testing using cypress.io. This included creating a SQL database in ElephantSQL. We did our API testing using jest and supertest. As part of that we wrote the code to test GET and POST. 

### Day 38: 6 November 2022

- Worked on the week 6 recap homework which was to test a full stack app. 

### Day 39: 7 November 2022

- Today we learned about how to create single-page React applications using Create React App. 

![Image](./Images/React%20JS.png)

### Day 40: 8 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
-  Solved a kata with my pairing partner this week by using JavaScript String split() and the Spread (...) operator. I worked on this particular kata with two different fellow programmers so it felt wonderful to finally solve it! 
-  At School of Code today we also learned and practiced coding using:
    - JavaScript array methods such as map(), filter(), some(), every(), and sort().  
    - React components: creating, building and nesting components.

### Day 41: 9 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
-  Learned about React useState hooks: const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

### Day 42: 10 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Learned about React lists and keys
- Immutable updates to objects and arrays

**Thoughts:** Every day on my lunch break I try to walk outside. It's great for my health and also [scientifically proven](https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/) to boost creative thinking by an average of 60 percent! A perfect aid for effective problem solving. 

![Image](./Images/walk_woods.jpg)

### Day 43: 11 November 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Hackathon Friday at School Of Code. We attempted to use the skills in Reactjs that we've been learning all week to create a "To do list" app. My pairing partner and I decided that we needed to go back to understanding some of the basics of React such as State and Props. As a result, we spent some time going through The Net Ninja's YouTube playlist, [Full React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) and discussing it to make sure we understood it.  

### Day 44: 12 November 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Today I learned [How to Transform Your #100DaysOfCode Log Into a Visual Experience](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-transform-your-100daysofcode-log-into-a-visual-experience-d048334af8d9/) thanks to this Free Code Camp article. 
- I have subsequently updated this log with images, links, and formatting changes with the help of Markdown code such as:

**Thoughts:** After an intense week, when I was sick with the flu and trying to learn how to code using React JS, I needed a mental break. I found it encouraging and motivating learning how to improve my #100daysofcode log on #github to make it more interesting to read. One of these days I'll hopefully be posting some actual projects, but for now this is a good first step. This quote from Code First Girls was just what I needed to read today:

 ![Image](./Images/ResultsHappenOverTime.jpg)

 ### Day 45: 14 November 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Learned about pure functions in Reactjs such as useEffect hook. How to fetch data from an API using fetch, useEffect and useState. 

 ### Day 46: 15 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:

Learned about branch management in Git. This included learning some new git commands such as:

* git checkout main. 

* git push --set-upstream origin newBranchName

We also learned about useReducer which is a hook that allows you to manage your state in React when you want to keep everything under control.

 ### Day 47: 16 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:

Refactored a list with useReducer from The School of Code useReducer Workshop 

Worked on solving a 6kyu kata in Code Wars with my pairing partner.
