# 100 Days Of Code Log

### Introduction

![Image](./Images/super_64.png) 

Welcome to my #100 Days of Code Log as I take on the challenge to code at least an hour a day for the next 100 days! I am joining the brave new world of learning how to code by starting the School of Code's full stack web development bootcamp. It's full time for the next four months but it's also free. The application process was lengthy but **School of Code only accepted 3% of the 4000 applicants for my cohort.** How could I turn down the opportunity?

### Day 1: 26 September 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned new CSS selectors and practiced them while pair programming with CSS Diner

**Link(s) to work**: [CSS Diner](https://lnkd.in/ePbUsARa) 

**Thoughts:** Made it through my first day at School of Code and loved it. The founder and CEO, Chris Meah, told us today that a more accurate name for School of Code is "Technology Career Intensive Onboarding of Collaborative Creative Problem Solvers." I am excited to start my journey learning to code with all these new people!

#uiuxdesign #collaboration

### Day 20: 15 October 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Continued coding functions, loops, and arrays for the JavaScript Recap workshop with School Of Code.
- One of the many things I love about School of Code is they connect each of us with a mentor who works in the tech industry already and is willing to meet with us 1:1 each week. Arthur is my mentor and he has encouraged me so much already with his tips, advice, and support. He sent me an inspiring quote this morning when I was feeling discouraged and I've been repeating it to myself all day. Thank you, Arthur!

#apitesting #cypress #freecodecamp

### Day 36: 3 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Forked the #100daysofcode template and added all my notes from Notion, Tweets, and posts on LinkedIn from my first 35 days of the challenge into this 100 Days of Code log. It's a clear sign of how far I have come in a such a short time since when I started the 100 Days of Code challenge I didn't know how to use Github or VSCode and definitely didn't know how to fork a repo!
- Learned about NoSQL from guest speakers from Couchbase
- With my pair programming partner this week we created our own Kata for Code Wars and the tests required to check our CodeWarrior's solutions. We started with some simple ones which worked fine. Then we started creating a more complicated one but haven't finished it yet.
- We also learned about NoSQL from Couchbase at School of Code today. It was interesting to learn more about it.

- Today we learned about how to create single-page React applications using Create React App. 

![Image](./Images/React%20JS.png)

### Day 40: 8 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
-  Solved a kata with my pairing partner this week by using JavaScript String split() and the Spread (...) operator. I worked on this particular kata with two different fellow programmers so it felt wonderful to finally solve it! 
-  At School of Code today we also learned and practiced coding using:
    - JavaScript array methods such as map(), filter(), some(), every(), and sort().  
    - React components: creating, building and nesting components.

### Day 41: 9 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
-  Learned about React useState hooks: const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

### Day 42: 10 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Learned about React lists and keys
- Immutable updates to objects and arrays

**Thoughts:** Every day on my lunch break I try to walk outside. It's great for my health and also [scientifically proven](https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/) to boost creative thinking by an average of 60 percent! A perfect aid for effective problem solving. 

![Image](./Images/walk_woods.jpg)

### Day 43: 11 November 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Hackathon Friday at School Of Code. We attempted to use the skills in Reactjs that we've been learning all week to create a "To do list" app. My pairing partner and I decided that we needed to go back to understanding some of the basics of React such as State and Props. As a result, we spent some time going through The Net Ninja's YouTube playlist, [Full React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) and discussing it to make sure we understood it.  

### Day 44: 12 November 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Today I learned [How to Transform Your #100DaysOfCode Log Into a Visual Experience](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-transform-your-100daysofcode-log-into-a-visual-experience-d048334af8d9/) thanks to this Free Code Camp article. 
- I have subsequently updated this log with images, links, and formatting changes with the help of Markdown code such as:

**Thoughts:** After an intense week, when I was sick with the flu and trying to learn how to code using React JS, I needed a mental break. I found it encouraging and motivating learning how to improve my #100daysofcode log on #github to make it more interesting to read. One of these days I'll hopefully be posting some actual projects, but for now this is a good first step. This quote from Code First Girls was just what I needed to read today:

 ![Image](./Images/ResultsHappenOverTime.jpg)

 ### Day 45: 14 November 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Learned about pure functions in Reactjs such as useEffect hook. How to fetch data from an API using fetch, useEffect and useState. 

 ### Day 46: 15 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:

Learned about branch management in Git. This included learning some new git commands such as:
* git checkout ‚Äìb adding-to-remote. This creates a new branch called ‚Äúadding-to-remote‚Äù and switches to it at the same time.

* git checkout main. 

* git push --set-upstream origin newBranchName

We also learned about useReducer which is a hook that allows you to manage your state in React when you want to keep everything under control.

 ### Day 47: 16 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:

Refactored a list with useReducer from The School of Code useReducer Workshop 

Worked on solving a 6kyu kata in Code Wars with my pairing partner. 

Had a refresh on writing test code in preparation for our group project next week. 

Then worked on a React Component Testing workshop.

**Link(s) to work**: [JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/fcc1c4bc12a-0732-4d31-8cf5-256370ff73f5) 

 ### Day 5: 21 November 2022

 **Today's Progress**:

 This week at School of Code we have been put into groups of four and asked to design a full stack web application which helps to address challenges that bootcampers face while learning remotely. At the end of the week we‚Äôll present our solution to a panel of judges from the industry

One of our goals this week is to use Agile software development practices as we plan, manage, develop, and present our app. Therefore, as a team we first agreed upon our Team Manifesto core items and recovery strategy. We then used a Jamboard and the Disney Ideation Method to brainstorm ideas and then narrow them down. We also completed our user stories, component tree, and low-fidelity wireframe on Figma. 

Before starting my day with School of Code, I watched YouTube instructional videos by Net Ninja about Node.js and React (Using JSON Server and useEffect Dependencies).

![Image](./Images/ComponentTree_DatabasePlanningTable_API.RequestPaths.jpg)

 ### Day 52: 22 November 2022

 **Today's Progress**:

 Today we created a Kanban board on Trello for project management purposes. We then spilt into programming pairs with one pair starting to build the front-end and the other working on the back-end. 

For the back-end, we drew a diagram showing what tables our database would contain and how they join. We also wrote an API planning table for the requests that our back-end would handle. Then we created a PostgreSQL database in railway.app

**Thoughts:** 

This was a very stressful day. Friction that we had in the team yesterday became worse today. One of our colleagues wasn‚Äôt in tune with the rest of the team and we found ourselves spending too much energy articulating why we were doing what we agreed upon previously, trying to push forward against a force pushing back. Halfway through the afternoon, it became unbearable and our team reached a breaking point. 

![Image](./Images/Kanban%20Planning%20Board.jpg)

 ### Day 53: 23 November 2022

 **Today's Progress**:

One of the challenges today was connecting the front and back ends that we had developed. We ended up downloading a node.js package called CORS which provides Express middleware and tweaking our React components to respond appropriately. 

We also had a console.log inside an async function which threw us off for a while until we noticed that we needed to move it out. 

We did manage to get two components to work correctly. 

 **Thoughts:** 

 We started today with uncertainty about what was going to happen to our team. We carried on working as a trio but we were still a bit lost, as it was difficult to proceed while things were actively changing. 

It stayed like that up until the mid-afternoon when we officially received a decision from School of Code that from then onwards we would be a team of three. We were clearly behind, but this confirmation gave us what we needed which was certainty. For the rest of the afternoon, the three of us reassessed our situation, rewrote our Recovery plan, and started reconsidering our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.  

![Image](./Images/Our%20App%20at%20the%20end%20of%20Wed.jpg)

### Day 54: 24 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:

This morning at our daily stand-up we decided that our goal by the end of the day was for our app to have a modularized dashboard with clear sections and to be visually well structured. We had to make a few sacrifices on our original plan to reach our revised MVP by the end of the day, such as:
* Testing our app
* Making sure it was accessible and 
* Officially naming our solution.

After revising our MVP, we came up with a colour scheme, modified our low-fidelity wireframe, and discussed our priorities and responsibilities for tasks using our Kanban board on Trello. 

I learned today how to use CSS in React to style components and enjoyed seeing immediate, visual results from my coding.  

At the end of every day this week we met for a retrospective, using the 4Ls technique, to discuss what we Loved, Loathed, Longed For, and Learned that day.

![Image](./Images/Our%20App%20at%20midday%20on%20Thurs.jpg)

### Day 55: 25 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:

Today our focus was on preparing and presenting our App to a panel of judges from the industry. 

Our solution is a dashboard to help bootcampers decompresses after an intense day of learning. It has activities, organized by category, which help to boost wellbeing. You can add to it each day and view your progress based on your goals. It also has a random joke generator. Finally, there‚Äôs a prompt to write down things that you are grateful for with a list reminding you of what you have been thankful for in the past. 

*Tools used:* Jamboard, Figma, Trello, VSCode, Git, GitHub, Zoom, Google docs, and Google Slides

*Tech Stack used:* JavaScript ES6, Node.js, Expres.js, React.js, PostgreSQL (ElephantSQL and Railway.app), HTML, and CSS

 **Thoughts:** 

We had unavoidable setbacks this week and then we became a team of three when we were already behind. After that, although our team was smaller we worked as a cohesive team, celebrated our victories however small, and our productivity level shot through the roof. 

The big take away for us is how important mindset and a positive attitude is when facing challenges as a team. We had a unique chance to experience the type of obstacles one might face in a real work environment. It was important for us to keep moving forward and to stay agile. 

This week, we lived out the following values from The Agile Manifesto:
* Responding to change over following a plan
* Individual and interactions over processes and tools and 
* Working software over comprehensive documents 

I am incredibly grateful to my teammates on this project, Gabe and Milly. They were supportive, encouraging, kind, flexible, resilient, and brilliant at coding too! We faced huge challenges but overcame them together, working as a cohesive team with a positive attitude. At the end of the week we presented to the judges a functioning app which was coded almost entirely in a day. What an achievement!

### Day 56: 28 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Before SoC started this morning, I read in the Reactjs docs about State to reinforce my understanding.

At School of Code today, we spent the morning in our project groups from last week holding our Sprint Retrospective. We created a Trello board to discuss what went well, what needs improvement, and action items for the future. I also learned how to add a voting option for the Trello cards so we could have a team vote on the three ideas we‚Äôd like to see at the top of the list. 

In the afternoon, we focused on Code Reviews. We read up on code review guidelines and then met with another team from last week to review their code (and vice versa).

### Day 57: 29 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Today we started implementing some changes to the code in our project based on the feedback that we received from our peer code review yesterday.
* We learned how to use the JSDoc Tool for adding documentation comments to our code. 
* We simplified the code as much as possible. 
* We learned about the¬†readme.so tool to create documentation for our front and back ends.
* We practiced reviewing code in a branch before approving it to be merged with the main branch in Github. My teammate, Milly, created tests using Cypress and tested some of the components from our project. She wrote the test in a branch file, so when she went to merge it to our main file, she added Gabe and me as reviewers in GitHub so we could practice how it works. Then we each went through it, making comments, modifying any code, and then merging it. 
* I also learned about the "git mv" feature to fix a file name on our main branch which kept reverting back to the wrong name. 

 **Thoughts:** 
I really enjoyed today and feel that I learned a lot. As we were reviewing our code, I tried to explain out loud to my teammates what the code was doing. My teammates were brilliant at explaining anything I didn't understand. They are also helping me to start using the correct syntax. Often I understand and can explain the logic of the code but don't remember the correct technical words to use (such as "rendering a component").

### Day 58: 30 November 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Created README docs for the frontend and backend repos from our group project from last week. Finished writing JSDoc comments in the code for both the frontend and backend repos. As we went through the code again, it was good to review my understanding of how each part connects and communicates with other parts from the front to the backend. 

### Day 59: 1 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Today we learned about Identity as a Service (IDaaS), a cloud-based authentication built and operated by a third-party provider. Examples of IDaaS providers are Auth0, AWS Cognito, Firebase, and Supabase. In the afternoon I started trying to set up authentication on the frontend of a React project. I used [Autho0](https://auth0.com/) to integrate the following features within a single-page React app:
* Allow users to login
* Allow users to log out
* If a user is logged in, display their information (e.g. name, email, image URL)

### Day 60: 2 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Today I continued working on yesterday's project. I learned how to call an API that validates ourJSON Web Tokens. The aim was to get our user's metadata to display on the page and we managed to do it!

Next, we worked on protecting the backend of our React project. We created an API that supports the following routes:  
* GET /api/public
* GET /api/private
* GET /api/private-scoped

It took ages to figure out how to get the last one (private-scoped) to work but we finally managed to find and tick the right boxes in the Auth0 API settings to get it to work (hint: check the Machine to Machine Applications tab).

In the last few minutes of the day, I built a React app from scratch that uses authentication via Auth0. The one bit I haven't figure out yet is how to code it so that you can only access the app once you have logged in. Right now it's showing on the main page and also when you log in. Will tackle that problem another day. 

Today I also added a demo video to the README files for our week 9 Group Project:
[Globally Scoped Project Frontend](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc13_w9_project-frontend-globally-scoped)
and
[Globally Scoped Project Backend](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc13_w9_project-backend-globally-scoped)

### Day 61: 5 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Learned and practiced how to deploy React app projects via [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). 

### Day 62: 6 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Learned and practiced how to deploy a backend environment using [Render](https://render.com/). Then deployed the related frontend (a React app shopping list) via [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). 

The highlight for me today was learning how to set up my React App from last Friday (2 Dec) so that the user has to log in first before they had access to the app, their user info and their user metadata. 

To do this, we leveraged the Identity as a Service (IDaaS), Auth0 React SDK. It is a JavaScript library for implementing authentication and authorization in React. We used the useAuth0 hook in our components to access authentication states such as (isAuthenticated and user), authentication methods such as logout, as well as the logical conjunction (&&) operator to do it.

In the morning I also completed some katas on Code Wars with my pairing partner for an hour. We started going through [Katas list of Training JS series](https://github.com/myjinxin2015/Katas-list-of-Training-JS-series) together. 

### Day 63: 7 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Today we learned about a React Hook called useContext that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.

**Links to resources**: 
[React Hooks: useContext](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useContext)  and [Passing Data Deeply with Context](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

### Day 64: 8 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
This morning I completed a CodeWars kata with my pairing partners. Then we worked on completing the workshop from yesterday on custom hooks. 

In the afternoon, we learned more about [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/). Couchbase is a DataBase as a Service (DBaaS) provider. 

### Day 65: 9 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Hackathon Friday at School of Code. Our challenge was to ideate, plan, and build a full stack app that included:
* Deployed front and back ends that talk to each other
* Use of the useContext hook somewhere in your app
* Use of at least one custom hook somewhere in your app

It was a huge challenge to do in just 5 hours. We managed the first task and had started on the second one when it was time to present at the end of day. 

 **Thoughts:** 
How do you maintain motivation to keep going when you are worn out? After twelve weeks of intensive learning with the School Of Code boot camp, I took the advice that Women In Technology (WIT) shared below so I can press on to keep going in my #100daysofcodechallenge.

### Day 66: 13 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
We started learning about TypeScript today. Here's a little code snipped from the first part of our workshop practicing writing in TypeScript:

## Code Snippets

```tsx
/* TASK 1.1: declare and initialize a boolean variable */
let isTrue: boolean = true;

/* declare and initialize a string variable */
let myName: string = "Stephanie";

/* declare and initialize a number */
let myAge: number = 32;

/* declare and initialize an array of booleans */
let isVeryTrue: boolean[] = [true, false];

/* declare and initialize an array of strings */
let stringArray: string[] = ["2", "b", "6"];

/* TASK 1.2: Declare and implement a function which takes in two numbers and 
returns their sum.*/
function totalSum(a: number, b: number) {
  return (a + b);
}
console.log(totalSum(2, 8));

/* TASK 1.3: Declare a new type that describes an object containing the keys and 
types below: 
amount: a number
uniqueId: a string
isValid: a boolean
addressLines: an array of strings */

type Data = {
    amount: number;
    uniqueID: string;
    isValid: boolean;
    addressLines: string[];
};

function getData(personalData: Data) {
    return personalData.uniqueID; 
}
console.log(getData(
    { 
    amount: 15, 
    uniqueID: "Sam", 
    isValid: true,
    addressLines: ["1 Park Lane", "2 Falcon Way"] 
    }
    ));

    /* TASK 1.4: Declare a new type which is any one of: "BLUE" or "YELLOW" */
    function setColor(color: string | string ) {
        return "My favourite color is " + color;
    }
    console.log(setColor("BLUE"));

    console.log(setColor("YELLOW"));
```
### Day 67: 14 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Learned how to convert React JavaScript to TypeScript. Spent the day with my pairing partner converting all the .js components of a ‚Äúto-do list‚Äù React app to .tsx components. 

### Day 68: 15 December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Today we learned how to use VS Code to debug code. We also learned a bit more about how to code using TypeScript.  

Tomorrow I have a progress interview. Therefore, I also took some time to review the code from our week 9 group project to make sure I understood it. My programming pair partner for this week, Beatrice, was kind enough to let me practice explaining it to her. She asked me some good questions about it too. 

In the evening I met with my mentor, Arthur, and he helped me review and practice answering common interview questions that a someone might be asked when interviewing for a software development job. 

### Day 69: 16th December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Hackathon Friday at School of Code. With our programming pair partner our challenge was to build a weather checker app using Typescript and React. The user needed to be able to input the name of a city and have weather information about that city added to the page. 

We first made a plan then created a component tree diagram in Miro before we started any coding. I had my progress interview in the middle of the day so Beatrice did a large chunk of the coding during the 1 1/2 hours that I was away for my interview. 

In the last bit of time we had at the end of the day we managed to add a background image and weather icon which reflects the city's weather.

### Day 70: 17th December 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Continued to work through more of the Free Code Camp curriculum for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. 

 **Link to work**: [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/fcc1c4bc12a-0732-4d31-8cf5-256370ff73f5) 

 **Thoughts:** 
I have now completed the first twelve weeks of the School of Code (SoC) boot camp. When I started, the only coding I knew how to do was some basic Python from the Code First Girls intro course I took last summer. I didn't know any JavaScript, HTLM, or CSS. I didn't know how to use Git or GitHub either. In these past twelve weeks, we have been taught an incredible amount and I've worked incredibly hard - day, night, and on the weekend. I still feel so behind though in my comprehension and was feeling quite discouraged yesterday. 

However, Bee helped me gain some perspective by pointing out that before our SoC boot camp started, she spent two months going through some Udemy courses on JavaScript (while also working). At our SoC bootcamp we only spent 3 days learning what she had spent a full 2 months learning on her own. 

I really enjoyed going through this basic JavaScript course on Free Code Camp today. It's so much eaiser on my brain. I'm learning things that so many other on my SoC course already knew before they started. Some of these concepts look familiar to me because we have used them in our coding at SoC but I had not learned them yet.
